#### *Mathematical Thinking*
##### *Generalize*

**Arithmetic** - the properties of operations on numbers, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Algebra** - the part of mathematics in which letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in [formulae](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&sca_esv=332c1457e26e21ac&sxsrf=ADLYWILRgP9kklg3J9k66_dgSsZtaEAaHQ:1732262976466&q=formulae&si=ACC90nwZKElgOcNXBU934ENhMNgqFoL9_X_SYefTJ_aiebUbV0fHvM2kiU0ZaA-b5vp8BcMJv2GZjV20hR2GmfKMJq65v31zelTTC3tWif5aAnvntU_Wxt0%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiio_q6vu-JAxUmRaQEHengIikQyecJegQIXBAN) and equations.

When you're given a question, such as “What is 1+3+5 ?”, even if you know how to find the answer, you should stop to ask yourself:
- Can I see some unusual pattern here?
- Will this pattern hold for other similar problems?
- How can I prove it?

**Generalize** : Always be looking for patterns and thinking of ways to use them. Depending on the problem, a pattern can turn an hour of aimless arithmetic into a single “aha!” moment.

##### *Rewrite, Rethink, Redraw*

This shape is called the **Sierpinski Triangle** and it's a well known example of a **fractal**. A fractal is a pattern where similar patterns appear at all smaller scales as you zoom in.

Also see **Sierpinski's Carpet.**

- multiplying by a fraction smaller than 11 removes chunks in a regular way, smaller each time, ultimately producing a hollow fractal at the end.

- multiplying by a fraction bigger than 11 adds chunks in a regular way, bigger each time, ultimately growing to infinity in an exponential fashion.
