Hi,

Thank you for your reply. I'm happy to continue the discussion and answer your questions

- **Why this assignment?** I have a strong interest in the observability stack for network and service supervision. I particularly enjoy working with large datasets to identify root causes of issues or bugs, which this role would allow me to explore in depth. In my current role at Orange, I’ve been involved in developing tools tailored to the needs of supervision and network operations. I’ve worked with skilled people and gained hands-on experience with tools like Grafana and Prometheus,and others, including creating a custom Grafana plugin for data visualization. These experiences have strengthened my enthusiasm for this domain.
- **Why Thales?** I was looking for an internship at a large, innovative company, as I believe this environment suits my working style. Thales stood out to me for its advanced technology and work in the naval domain, which I find particularly fascinating. The blend of cutting-edge technology and unique challenges in this field excites me. Additionally, a classmate interned at Naval Group in France and shared positive feedback about his experience, which motivated me to apply.
- **Why the Netherlands?** I wanted to stay within Europe for my internship, as I appreciate the culture and diversity across the region. Having traveled to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, I’ve greatly enjoyed my experiences and would love the opportunity to immerse myself further. The cultural similarities make it a comfortable transition, but I’m also eager for new challenges and perspectives that this internship could offer.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to discuss this opportunity further in an interview. My working hours are flexible, so I can adjust to fit your schedule. Please feel free to suggest any timeslots the coming weeks.
