### Brillant :
The **numerator** is the number above the fraction bar. It represents the number of selected items in a group, or the number of selected pieces of a whole.

The **denominator** is the number below the fraction bar. It represents the total number of items in a group, or the total number of pieces of a whole.

Percents can be written as fractions with 100 in the denominator.

We can write ratios as fractions, with denominator equal to the total number of parts present. ( 2:7 = 2/9 )

Percentage
When a quantity **increases** by a given percentage, we first find that percentage of the original quantity, then **add** it to the original to get the new amount.
When a number **increases** by a percentage more than once, the amount it grows by is **larger** each time.
Same for the decrease


**Exponential Notation for Powers of Two**
The numbers $2$, $2^2$, $2^3$, ... , $2^n$, and so on, are called **powers of two**. The number n is called an **exponent**.

**The Product Rule for Exponents**
For any number a raised to powers b and c.
$a^b*a^c=a^{b+c}$

**Scientific Notation**

In scientific notation convention, a number is written as a power of ten, times a number that's between one and ten. This number, called the **coefficient** is greater than or equal to one, but strictly less than ten.

Another way to think of this convention is that the power of ten is chosen such that there is exactly one nonzero digit in the coefficient located left of the decimal point.

8 000 000 000 humans, weighing about 60 kg each, means humanity weighs about $4.8*10^{11}$ kg so $4.8*10^{8}$ tonnes
